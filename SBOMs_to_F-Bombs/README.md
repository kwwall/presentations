# From SBOMs to F-Bombs: Vulnerability Analysis, SCA Tools, and False Positives & Negatives

My slide deck from [BSides Columbus 2023](https://www-bsidescolumbus-com.filesusr.com/html/98d815_d33864d07d427e1d5b1599e3e5338997.html#)
and [OWASP Global AppSec DC 2023](https://owasp2023globalappsecwashin.sched.com/event/1OL8y) is below.

Note that other than a few
fixed typos and a change to the title slide, the presentation for OWASP Global AppSec DC on Oct 31, 2023
was identical to the presentation at BSides Columbus made on Sept 15, 2023. Therefore, only the
OWASP AppSec DC slide deck is presented here.
